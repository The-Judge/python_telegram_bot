# About this Repository

This repo contains code to be used as "follow along" - resource for my article series
"Create your own Telegram bot with Django on Heroku" available at my Blog at 
https://www.marc-richter.info/series/create-your-own-telegram-bot-with-django-on-heroku/.

# How should I use it?

After each article, I will add the essence of that article and add it to this repository.
The changes can then be found in the repositories commit history and allows to easily 
check what has been changed.

To make it even more easy to find the state for the actual chapter you are trying to work
with, I will add two Git Tags per chapter:

* partX_start  
* partX_end

With "X" replaced by the corresponding article from the Blog.  
I consider the names quite self explanatory.

# Q: I'm just noticing this with Part 11 - How comes I never noticed this before?

The answer is quite easy: This repo did not exist when I wrote the first 10 parts of the 
article series.

# Q: Why did you decide to create this repo now?

I started this article series back in August 2018. I never
intended it to grow larger than 2-3 articles. After I started writing it, I quickly found
myself with more and more parts filling quite long article pages (from an SEO perspective:
Too long) with quite high-dense content without an end in sight even after Part 10.

I have to admit, that I completely underestimated the amount of stuff which is important to 
mention in a series which should be catchy and easy to understand for audiences of all 
levels of experience. Quite much of what has turned _obvious_ and "_not worth to mention 
explicitly_" to me (with my own Python skills evolving over time), could lead to a beginner
not being able to follow. I read many articles myself that lost me even though I wanted 
to understand them really bad, but I just could not follow along and connect the dots when
large parts, which were considered too obvious to mention for an intermediate reader, were 
just missing, leading to a gap between the parts I just wasn't able to close myself.

Also, Part 10 has been published in December 2018. It wasn't before August 2020 that I
continued the series, due to change of jobs and a high amount of work that came along with 
it.

This huge pause was the main reason I had the idea for this repository. I wanted to
have something that makes re-entry to the series for people, who haven't heard from it
for far longer than 18 months (and most certainly forgot about most of the code we 
discussed), and readers, who hop on in Part 11 only, easier to adapt.
